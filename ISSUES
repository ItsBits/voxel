Issues:
* at low frame rates, keyboard feels unresponsive
    I assume it's because of GLFW being laggy. Slow refresh rate seem to register a key release + key press at key release
    Confirmed: GLFW3 bug

* verify correctness of multi threading, chunk loading / unloading (memory leaks / data loss)

* refactoring desperately needed (when all the basic ideas are implemented)
