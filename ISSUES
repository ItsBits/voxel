Issues:
* at low frame rates, keyboard feels unresponsive* frustum culling sometimes removes too many chunks
    I assume it's because of GLFW being laggy. Slow refresh rate seem to register a key release + key press at key release

Verify if solved:
* sometimes it appears that there is a deadlock when exiting loader thread
    (solution: introduce loader thread finished flag)
* chunk loading feels unresponsive when moving fast
    (observation: if player moves out of loaded range, incorrect chunks are marked for removal, this might explain remove assert VAO != 0 failure)
    (observation 2: loader tells renderer to remove chunks with meshes with size 0 and there is a lot of then, m_loaded_meshes is problematic because it stores all (also 0 size meshes))
    solution: use the goddamn member "empty" of m_loaded_meshes to check if mesh really needs to be removed
