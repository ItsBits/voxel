* TODO: find the source of exception : replace exceptions with assertions

* rename to: OverengineeredVoxelEngine :P

* multi threaded loader for loading new meshes
  use a separate thread for updating existing loaded meshes

* use mmap for faster io and maybe replace RAM copy of region by mmap

* player position should be chunk relative for float accuracy instead of absolute

* implicit remove meshes (remove on overwrite) + worker that searches for relly old chunks that are not used to remove them (maybe part of loader thread)
